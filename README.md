# The Adventures of Inday Scripts

Welcome! These are the compilation of scripts I made for my Thesis: an adventure game which revolves around the use of the unique Filipino writing system called Baybayin. I made this publicly available under an MIT License, for whoever may find it useful.

### The Game

The build is publicly available for download [here](https://therayofseasons.itch.io/the-adventures-of-inday).

Proudly made by CIIT students, now alumni!

### Author's Notes

Any `.meta` files and other assets are not included in this repository. Their application into the game is best left confidential. Should there be any further questions, do feel free to contact me here in GitHub by adding a new issue.
